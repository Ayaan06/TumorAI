# 🧠 AI-Powered Tumor Detection (Azure Machine Learning)

This project uses **Azure Machine Learning Studio**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow** to detect and classify tumors from MRI and CT scans using image classification techniques.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment to a cloud-based API endpoint.

## 🚀 Features
- Image classification using Azure ML pipelines  
- Multi-class labeling and data augmentation for improved accuracy (~20%)  
- Cloud deployment for real-time inference  
- Integration with Blob Storage and MLTable pipelines  

## 🧩 Tech Stack
**Azure Machine Learning • PyTorch • TensorFlow • Python • NumPy • OpenCV • MLTable • Blob Storage**

## 📂 Repository Structure
Explain each folder (data, notebooks, models, etc.)

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce
- Upload dataset to Azure Blob Storage  
- Configure MLTable  
- Run notebooks for data preprocessing and training  
- Deploy model via Azure ML endpoint  

## 📈 Results
Include accuracy numbers, confusion matrix, sample predictions.

## 📸 Screenshots
Add images of your Azure ML pipeline, confusion matrix, or model output.
